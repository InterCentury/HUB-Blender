Oooohhh 😌🔥

So now we have:

* 🎮 `HUB-UnrealEngine`
* 🎨 `HUB-Blender`

Bro is building his own creative ecosystem already 😏

Alright — here’s a clean, professional but still creative **README.md** for `HUB-Blender`.

# 🎨 HUB-Blender

> My personal Blender learning hub — modeling, materials, animation, and 3D experiments.

## 📌 About This Repository

**HUB-Blender** is my structured 3D learning space where I explore modeling, shading, animation, and rendering workflows.

This repository includes:

* 🧱 3D Models
* 🎨 Materials & Shaders
* 💡 Lighting Experiments
* 🎬 Animations
* 🖌 Texture Work
* 🧪 Practice Scenes
* 📝 Notes & Workflow Documentation

The goal is to improve my 3D skills and build assets for Unreal Engine and future game projects.

## 🧠 What I'm Learning

* Hard surface modeling
* Character basics
* Shader node system
* Lighting & composition
* Rendering (Cycles & Eevee)
* UV unwrapping
* Optimization for game engines
* Export workflow (FBX, glTF, VRM pipeline)
